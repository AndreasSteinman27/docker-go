# Top Navigation

### 1. **Description**

On load, Trim, Preliminary, and Documents are available to switch between.

Final Statement is reached when the required [Preliminary](../../forms/preliminary-statement.md) & Documents fields are filled, saved and preliminary generated.

Disbursement is reached when the required [Preliminary,](../../forms/preliminary-statement.md) Documents, and Final State fields are filled, saved, and final statement generated.
