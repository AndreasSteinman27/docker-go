# Overview

### **Who is this document for?**

Itâ€™s particularly useful for **developers** and **QA**. Developers who begin programming a software system without having clear document to hand often find they have problems later on with their code while QA will have no requirements to check against.

### **What is the aim of this document?**

To **seek clarity across the team**. By actually sitting down with members of other departments to write functional specification documents, we will be able to obtain buy-in at an early stage and make sure that everyone is onboard with the current direction. Our functional specification documentation serves as a roadmap for your developers and QA.

### How is it organized?

It is organized by developmental and design components to ensure a developer can find the necessary component and documentation.  It's a living document which means updates are expected to happen often.
