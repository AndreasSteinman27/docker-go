# Introduction

### **Who is this document for?**

This document is made for **Carputty Developers and QA**. Developers who begin programming a software system without having clear documentation on-hand often find they have problems later on with their code. QA Engineers with unclear requirements struggle to make automated testing and validate functionality. This document is designed to bridge the gap for Developers, Product, Design, and QA.

### **What is the aim of this document?**

To **serve as a centralized source of truth and reference manual for Axle UI components**. By actually sitting down with members of other departments to write functional specification documents, we will be able to obtain buy-in at an early stage for Axle's current direction. This document is **designed to be an ongoing conversation between all the product team members who work on Axle**.

### **What is a Design System?**

A **design system** is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

### **How is it different from a framework or component library?** 

Many organizations have what they consider to be a **design system**, but these collections typically amount to no more than a group of elements and code snippets. While a style guide or pattern library can be a starting point for a design system, they are not the only components. 

**In order to quickly iterate with confidence, design teams need access to a single source of truth that allows for a scalable UI language and streamlined UX guidelines**. Building a library of design patterns, rules, and UX guidelines prevent inconsistencies when shipping products at scale.

### **How are components organized?**

The term component gets thrown around alot in development. It's useful to think of component in terms of building block with each getting more complex as you move up in complexity.
