### **Who is this document for?**

This document is made for **Carputty Developers and QA**. Developers who begin programming a software system without having clear documentation on-hand often find they have problems later on with their code. QA with unclear requirements struggle to make automated testing. This document is designed to bridge the gap for Developers, Product, Design, and QA for building the **Axle system**.

### **What is the aim of this document?**

To **serve as a centralized source of truth and reference manual for Axle UI components**. By actually sitting down with members of other departments to write functional specification documents, we will be able to obtain buy-in at an early stage for Axle's current direction. This document is **designed to be an ongoing conversation between the product team**.
