# Axle Reference Manual

### **Who is this document for?**

Itâ€™s particularly useful for **developers** and **QA**. Developers who begin programming a software system without having clear documentation on-hand often find they have problems later on with their code, while QA will have no requirements to check against.

### **What is the aim of this document?**

To **serve as a centralized source of truth and reference manual for UI components**. By actually sitting down with members of other departments to write functional specification documents, we will be able to obtain buy-in at an early stage and make sure that everyone is onboard with the current direction. 

### How is it organized?

It is organized by developmental and design components to ensure a developer can find the necessary components and documentation.  It's a living document, we expect this manual to be updated often as changes are made to components.
