**Intended use**  
A generic text field that can be used as a base for different types of inputs. Should only be used directly for simple text fields with one-off \(non-validated\) data, otherwise, a different object should be created.

**Parent Object**

**Functional Requirements**

* Must take any character entered in
* Must respond to empty, focus, hover, error, and disabled states
  * The error state should appear if the field is required and the form is submitted with the field empty. If other validators are required, consider creating a unique object.

**Error Messaging**
