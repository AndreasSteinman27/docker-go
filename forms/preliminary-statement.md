{% tab title="Description" %}
The Preliminary Advance Statement is a document created within Axle that serves as a preliminary estimate for a given asset/transaction. The preliminary statement shows estimated transactional amounts, including the vehicle price/outstanding balance, the minimum down payment as calculated against our valuation for the vehicle, and any estimated taxes or fees. Its counterpart is the Final Advance Statement, which shows finalized values once the MSA is able to verify everything.

There are 3 different Preliminary Advance Statement types, one for each transaction type:
