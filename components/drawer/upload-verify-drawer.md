### Interactions



**Upload Component**

* If a valid file has already been uploaded, it should be displayed.
* The upload component should accept uploads either from the system file picker or from drag/drop.
  * If the user clicks the upload component, the system file picker should appear. Once a file is selected, an upload should be initiated with the selected file.
  * If the user drags a file to the upload component, an upload should be initiated with the selected file.
* Upon an upload being initiated, the file should be validated.
  * File must be an image/PDF\(?\) and under XMB.
* Once a successful upload is performed, the image should be displayed in the drawer, replacing any existing images if present.
* If the user uploads a file when another file was already uploaded, the old upload should be discarded and the new upload should replace the existing upload upon save.
  * The upload drawer can only accept one file at a time.

**Visual Inspection**

* If the Visual Inspection dropdown is null, the Save button should be inactive.
* If the MSA selects Pass or Fail on the Visual Inspection dropdown, the Save button should be activated.

**Save Button**

* The Save button's default state is inactive.
  * If it is clicked while inactive, nothing should happen.
* If the Save Button is clicked while active, the associated document should be updated with the appropriate status, any existing documents should be hidden/archived, the new document should replace the old document for the selected document type, and the drawer should close.
  * Verified if the Visual Inspection is Pass
  * Failed if the Visual Inspection is Fail

**Discard and Close Buttons**

* The Discard button should always be active. When clicked, it should discard any uploads or input received, and the drawer should close.
  * The close button behaves identically.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Error Handling" %}
1. If file validation fails, then an error should appear.
2. If file validation passes, the upload should begin. A progress bar should be shown with the upload.
