# Button



A button means an operation \(or a series of operations\). Clicking a button will trigger corresponding business logic.

In Ant Design we provide 5 types of button.

* [Primary button](primary-button.md): indicate the main action, one primary button at most in one section.
* [Secondary button](secondary-button.md) \(default button\): indicates a series of actions without priority.
* [Text button](text-button.md): used for the most secondary action.
* [Link button](link-button.md) \(tertiary button\): used for external links or could be used where you want to enable a user to take an action that is not valuable to most users.
